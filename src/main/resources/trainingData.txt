LUKE	CHARACTER
Well,	O
I	O
stumbled	O
across	O
a	O

him.	O

He	O
says	O
he	O
belongs	O
to	O
someone	O
called	O
Obi-Wan	O
Kenobi.	O

Owen	O
is	O
greatly	O
alarmed	O
at	O

of	O
his	O
name,	O
but	O
manages	O
to	O

himself.	O

LUKE	CHARACTER

thought	O

have	O
meant	O

he's	O
talking	O
about?	O

I	O
wonder	O

he's	O

Ben.	O

Owen	O
breaks	O

OWEN	O
That	O
